The Concept


The Army Pulse Radiation Facility (APRF) is designed to meet an
Army need for a facility located near the Eastern Seaboard capable
of providing large fast neutron and gamma radiation doses within
microseconds. This fast pulse radiation capability is necessary for
the determination of transient responses of materiel in nuclear
environments.

The APRF increases Army capability by providing improved simulation of
radiative effects of a nuclear burst for studies of Army interest, and
provides a facility for testing Army materiel. Because of its location,
the APRF economically and efficiently serves the heavy concentration of
Army agencies and contractors located along the Eastern Seaboard.

The design of the APRF is a direct outgrowth of projected user
requirements. Thus the reactor can be used both for high dose
irradiations of small objects, as a point source for radiation detector
studies, and irradiation of bulk objects. The former requirement led
to the incorporation of a 1½-inch OD “glory hole” running through
the center of the core, and providing a fast neutron fluence of
about 9 × 10¹⁴ neutrons per square centimeter per pulse. The latter
two requirements have resulted in the design of a large volume,
low-radiation backscatter Reactor Building. Provision is made for
moving the reactor both within the Reactor Building and to an outdoor
test site at heights variable up to 44 feet above ground by means of a
mechanical device called the reactor transporter. The reactor is also
capable of intermittent steady state operation in the kilowatt range
for classes of experiments requiring this mode of operation.

The Facility


The APRF is located on the military reservation of Aberdeen Proving
Ground (APG), in southeastern Harford County, Maryland. The Reactor
Building is at the center of the facility.

This building is a windowless, circular structure with aluminum siding.
Inside, the building is 100 feet in diameter and 65 feet high. There
is a roll-up door in the south wall for the passage of the reactor
transporter to the outdoor test site and another in the west wall for
the access of vehicles to the building. A shielded stairway and maze
provides access from the underground Control Building. This concrete
structure provides radiological shielding for the personnel and
controls associated with the operation of the reactor and the conduct
of experiments.

The area within a ~450-yard radius of the Reactor Building constitutes
the APRF high-radiation area defined by a 10-foot anti-personnel fence.
This high-radiation area is in turn surrounded by a nearly concentric
restricted area defined at its outer boundary by a barbed wire warning
fence at a radius of ~1500 yards from the Reactor Building.

The Laboratory Building, located at the periphery of the restricted
area, houses the administrative and support personnel for the APRF.
Access to APRF is controlled at this point.

The Reactor


The reactor, (APRFR), is designed for both self-limited,
super-prompt-critical pulse operation and steady state operation. The
maximum available pulse has a yield of ~2.1 × 10¹⁷ fissions, while
steady state operation is limited to about 10 kilowatts by the reactor
core cooling system and activation of the core.

[Illustration: High Yield Prompt Pulse Shape]

The APRFR is an advanced version of the Health Physics Research
Reactor (HPRR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), which has
been operating since 1962. ORNL has played a key role in the design
and testing of the APRFR. In pulse operation, the power level may
rise on periods as short as 10 microseconds. Electro-mechanical scram
systems are too slow to terminate such an excursion. Shutdown results
from increased neutron leakage due to fuel expansion, resulting in
a large prompt negative temperature coefficient of reactivity. This
self-limiting feature depends almost entirely on the thermal expansion
of the fuel alloy, and thus it is regarded as completely reliable and
safe.

Following a pulse, additional reactor shutdown capability is provided
by a safety block which, when ejected from the core, reduces the
reactivity to about 20 dollars below delayed-critical. At lower yield
pulses, below about 6 × 10¹⁶ fissions, the safety block is ejected by
the electro-mechanical scram system in about 0.1 seconds after a pulse.
At higher yield pulses, the safety block is ejected in much shorter
times due to thermo-mechanical shock forces which cause the safety
block to bounce out. The large shutdown margin provided by the safety
block is also the primary design device for preventing accidental
criticalities during periods of reactor shutdown.

The APRFR core is an unmoderated cylindrical assembly containing about
125 kilograms of an alloy of uranium 235 containing 10% molybdenum. The
actual core mass varies with the experiment. The core is cylindrical
and consists of two concentric annuli: a fixed outer shell of stacked
fuel discs bolted together with nine fuel bolts and Inconel nuts and
a movable inner safety block, also of fuel alloy. The 1½-inch OD
“glory hole” runs vertically through the center of the safety block.
Key reactor data is summarized in Tables I and II. The APRFR has been
operated during tests at ORNL at more than twice its design yield.

Exposure Locations and Performance Levels


The highest fluence and dose rates are available in the 1½-inch glory
hole. Since the reactor is supported from above by the transporter, the
areas around and below the core are also available for experiments.

The core can be positioned by remote control anywhere within the range
of travel of the transporter. Vertical travel is limited to about 44
feet above the Reactor Building floor level. Horizontal travel is
limited by the range of the rails on which the transporter travels. Six
pairs of rails extend radially from a turntable in the center of the
Reactor Building. These rails terminate within the Reactor Building,
except for one pair which extends 90 feet outside the building to an
outdoor test site. Each pair of rails defines one experimental location
where semi-permanent equipment and shielding can be set up without
tying up the entire reactor operation.

Fluence and flux data for three typical exposure locations are given in
Table III. In the absence of reflecting material beyond 1 meter from
core center (position P3), these values fall off essentially as

     1
    ——
     R²

where R is the distance to core center. Other performance data are
summarized in Tables IV through VIII.

APRF User Support Facilities


APRF is designed and staffed to assist its users in all key areas
relating to reactor utilization.

=Physical Space= Several areas in the underground Control Building
are available to experimenters. These include the trailer tunnel with
room for two full-sized trailers, the data acquisition room, and the
instrument shop. All of these areas are provided with conduits so that
cables can be run directly to them from the Reactor Building. In the
trailer tunnel the minimum cable length required to run to the core
surface is about 30 feet.

The exposure areas in the Reactor Building and the outdoor test site
are equipped with conduits for communication and instrumentation cables.

Available areas in the Laboratory Building include a high-bay set
up area, a machine shop, laboratory space, fume hood with remote
manipulator, photography laboratory, and offices.

=Data Acquisition and Processing= The basic element here is the
APRF Data Acquisition System described in Table IX. Various other
instrumentation is available as summarized in Table IX. Data processing
is available at the ARDC computer center and with on-line equipment at
APRF.

=Dosimetry= Routine dosimetry is performed by APRF personnel.
Methods available include fluence and spectrum measurements using
foil techniques, glass rod microdosimetry, thermoluminescence, and
diverse active dosimeters. Foils are analyzed using the APRF Automatic
Dosimetry System and data are available within a short time following
exposure.

Measurements are supplemented by analytical methods including one
and two dimensional transport theory, Monte Carlo, and special foil
analysis codes.

=Staff= The APRF staff is available to guide, plan and set up
experiments at the reactor, perform dosimetry, and assist in data
acquisition. APRF participation is determined on a case-by-case basis.

=Health Physics= Health physics survey, monitoring, decontamination
and related services are available in conjunction with the BRL Health
Physics Division.

Instructions To Potential Users


It is imperative to realize that there are stringent safety
requirements connected with the use of the APRFR. All experiments will
follow a written test plan approved at APRF. In order to perform an
experiment with maximum usefulness and efficiency, it is essential
that APRF be contacted during the early planning stages of a potential
experiment. Failure to do this may result in erroneous experiment
planning as regards safety and use of exposure space resulting in
schedule delays, and possibly cancellation or drastic revision of the
experiment.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
